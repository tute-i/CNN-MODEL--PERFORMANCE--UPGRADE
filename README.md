I noticed that the accuracy of the image data increased by applying the Lorentz transformation to the algorithm. My starting and ending accuracy values were higher when I applied the Lorentz transformation, and there were changes in the images after the Lorentz transformation. In classical machine learning, the Lorentz transformation did not make any changes. The success rate in CNN-based machine learning has increased. The outputs are attached. I would like to get your opinion on my work.
